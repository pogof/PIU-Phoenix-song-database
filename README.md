This project is more of a excercise then necessity.

Goals:
1. Write "scraper"/data formatter
2. Create a json database
3. Visualize the data in database
4. Make database at least a bit searchable

Song Names, Artists, Chart Difficulties and Jackets scraped from here:
https://piugame.com/leaderboard/top_steps.php

Database only includes songs in Full Mode and is accurate for PIU Phoenix v1.05.0

Other entries (original version, BPM, category, ...) were so far added manually from multiple sources (Jacket art, PIU update notice, Pumpout or elsewhere on the internet)
